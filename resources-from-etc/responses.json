The golems have a little over 92K health as far as I can tell.\nThe golems spawn at 6:15, he has enough of them dead to fill the font by 7:23 and them all dead by 7:33 while having dealt 80K to Telos. From 6:15 to 7:33 he's doing about 700K DPM. Obviously that's with AOE shenanigans but that is nuts.\nGoing from 7:33 to 8:30 he deals about 120K directly to Telos while dealing with fucking red golems.\nLiterally everything about this kill is so damn intentional and well executed, with genius strategies, and before anyone says it - yes - plenty of luck but it was dumb luck, it was just grinding for hours upon hours, death after death to get what he needed to find the kill. It doesn't change the fact that this was insanely skilled. He didn't just flounder around or anything, he made the right calls to get this kill.\nThe kill takes 8:30, meaning despite everything his DPM was still 94K just on Telos.

He starts charging detonation and eats with his mammoth scroll.\nYou'll notice he reflects for a bit after the tendril and it's totally worth it because of the insane amount of damage he'd deal, and he uses barricade on the surge+auto attacks so he can conserve food without losing much adrenaline due to green beam, then just heals it back up with the hold still moving in to P2.\nIf we go to the end of the kill he has one solid food and 8 super saradomin brews, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that that decision to play P1 the way he did made this kill possible. Chugging brews instead of being able to eat more of his solid food could have easily cost him the entire thing with how close he had to cut every little bit of the fight.\nThere was so many situations where you'd be tempted to eat up, where you're risking your life if you don't, but he didn't because the greatest risk is taking no risks at all - not taking risks on this kill would just mean losing later on in the fight, so he accepts the danger. He accepts that he had to take a shitload of deaths to make this possible.\nP2 notice how he reflects with his rebounder, he's able to tank autos just fine like this and the health doesn't matter since he gets to heal back to full off the hold still while reflecting 10K damage.\nAlso just look at how much he stuns Telos through this phase, Telos barely gets to spec because couchy's (C)4TAAing for a ton of the phase and getting incredible hits - this lets him completely avoid a second tendril, which could easily prove lethal or just eat a fuckload of resources and ultimately lose him the kill in the long run.",
